      <p>
        <strong>Anime Recommendations</strong> was created as a calm and welcoming space for anime lovers to find 
        recommendations without feeling overwhelmed.  
        The design focuses on accessibility, readability, and low-sensory comfort; 
        using soft colors, clear navigation, and gentle animations.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is to make anime discovery enjoyable for everyone, including people who are 
        autistic, neurodivergent, or simply prefer a quieter digital environment.

      <h2>About the Creator</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Sofia</strong>, an anime enthusiast and accessibility advocate. </p> 
        <p>I created Anime Haven to combine two of my passions: story telling through animation and 
        inclusive web design.</p> 
        <p>I believe everyone deserves a space to explore what they love without stress or sensory overload.</p>  
        <p>This site is built with that care in mind — simple layouts, reduced motion options, and 
        meaningful recommendations curated by hand.</p>
        <p>With over five years of streaming, I have decided to begin sharing my recommendations for the best animes to watch. 
          I enjoy attending conventions with my friends, cosplaying as different characters and meeting new people.</p> 
        <p>I am a senior in university in the US and am the founder of the anime society!</p> 
          <p>I can't wait to share my knowledge and hopefully help you find your next great watch!</p>
